# FO4_FavoritesMenu
This will drastically slow down the game world whenever the HUD favorites menu is opened.
Now you have the time you need to select a favorited item.
The slow time effect is only applied if you are in combat.
The effect will also end after 30 seconds even if you havent closed the menu yet.
In that case it will revert back to normal real time.
